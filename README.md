# leonoverweel.com

This is the repository for my personal portfolio website, [leonoverweel.com](https://leonoverweel.com). The site runs on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator that takes content written in Markdown (past projects, current project, and blog posts) and builds them into HTML pages using my custom theme, **leon-overweel-com**. It's hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

To build the site locally:

1. Download and install [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing).
1. Clone this repository.
1. Run `hugo server` (with `- D` to also show draft posts).
1. Navigate to `localhost:1313` to see the site live.

If you use my site template for your own website, please let me know by dropping me an email (available on [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/leonoverweel)).
