description: "Collaboratively building the most comprehensive list of annual hackathons in the Netherlands at hackathonlist.nl"
---

With [hackathonlist.nl](http://hackathonlist.nl), I'm trying to build **the most comprehensive list of hackathons in the Netherlands**. It's meant to be a one-stop shop for you to find the names and dates of upcoming hackathons, as well as links to information about their past editions (winners etc.).

The site is build completely on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which means it's really just the README.md of [this git repository](https://github.com/leonoverweel/dutch-hackathons) converted to HTML â€” so anyone can easily fork the repo, add a hackathon, and create a pull request to add it to the site.

It looks like this:

{{< figure src="/images/projects/2017/dutch-hackathon-list/screenshot.png" >}}

You can check out the website at [hackathonlist.nl](http://hackathonlist.nl), or the git repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/leonoverweel/dutch-hackathons).
