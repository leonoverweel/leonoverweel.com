In late 2017, while I was studying abroad at the National University of Singapore, I started learning to row, indoors on an ergometer. Since I had no one to coach me, I'd take videos of myself on the rowing machine and send them to rowing friends back in the Netherlands to get feedback on my form.

## Training

Once I got back to the Netherlands, I joined up with Daniël Vos, Wouter Raateland, and Sigur Gouwens to form our "Keihard," our Ringvaart crew at student rowing club [Proteus Eretes](https://proteus-eretes.nl). Keihard translates literally to "rock hard," which is of course how hard we were planning to row in our upcoming race. (It makes more sense in Dutch.) Over the first months of 2018, we took the next important step: asking fellow Proteus rowers to be our coaches leading up to the race. As is tradition, we did so by baking them a cake.

During those early winter months, most of our training was indoors on ergometers. As the weather started to warm in February, we also started training in the boat, beginning in the club's more stable, wider and heavier C-class coxed 4 boats. During this time, we'd sometimes get to Proteus at seven in the morning for a boat training, only to find out that the Schie still had chunks of ice floating in it from the previous night's frost.

That meant that our cox and coach could go back to bed, and that we'd be doing an indoor session instead. And if it got really cold, we also had alternative ways to get our workout in, from jogging to ice skating.

As we progressed and spring set in, we eventually graduated into rowing a regular coxed four, which is much lighter but also much less stable. The first few sessions in that boat were definitely some of our toughest. But each session was a learning experience to be carefully logged in the _coachboekje_.

From the end of February to the end of March, we got about thirty boat sessions in, plus about as many indoor sessions, at four sessions a week. Usually a session would be ten to twenty kilometers. Some more memorable ones included a seven-kilometer internal race to determine which Ringvaart crew got which boat, and a Saturday row we did from Delft to Rotterdam and back.
