In June of 2018, three friends and I raced 100 kilometers. Here's the story of that journey, from [training](#training) and [race prep](#race-prep) to [the Ringvaart itself](#ringvaart).

## Training

In late 2017, while I was studying abroad at the National University of Singapore, I started learning to row---indoors on an ergometer. Since I had no one there to coach me, I took videos of myself on the rowing machine and sent them to rowing friends in the Netherlands to get feedback on my form.

Once I got back to the Netherlands myself, I joined up with Daniël Vos, Wouter Raateland, and Sigur Gouwens to form "Keihard," our Ringvaart crew at student rowing club [Proteus Eretes](https://proteus-eretes.nl). Keihard translates literally to "rock hard," which is of course how hard we were planning to row during the race. (It makes more sense in Dutch.) Over the first months of 2018, we took the next important step: asking fellow Proteus rowers to be our coaches leading up to the Ringvaart. As is tradition, we did so by baking them cakes.

During those early winter months, most of our training was indoors on ergometers. As the weather started to warm in February, we also started training in the boat, beginning in the club's more stable, wider and heavier C-class coxed 4 boats. During this time, we'd sometimes get to Proteus at seven in the morning for a boat training, only to find out that the Schie still had chunks of ice floating in it from the previous night's frost.

That meant that our cox and coach could go back to bed, and that we'd be doing an indoor session instead. And if it got really cold, we also had alternative ways to get our workout in, from jogging to ice skating.

As we progressed and spring set in, we eventually graduated into rowing a regular coxed four, which is much lighter but also much less stable. The first few sessions in that boat were definitely some of our toughest. But each session was a learning experience to be carefully logged in the _coachboekje_.

From the end of February to the end of May, we got about thirty boat sessions in, plus about as many ergs, at a total of four sessions a week. An outdoor session would be ten to twenty kilometers. Some more memorable ones included a seven-kilometer internal race to determine which Ringvaart crew got which boat, a Saturday row we did from Delft to Rotterdam and back, and a touring row we did on the day of the Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's royal wedding. (I remember because we watched the ceremony during our lunch break.)

As May drew to a close, it was time to start preparing for the Ringvaart.
