description: "Free Creative Commons YouTuve Stock Footage (FCCYSF) was my multi-year project to provide high quality stock footage to low budget filmmakers, for free."

FCCYSF stands for Free Creative Commons YouTube Stock Footage, and it's a project to provide low-budget film makers with exactly that: high quality, royalty-free public domain footage to use in their projects.

The channel currently features **over 250 pieces of stock footage** and has **850+ subscribers** and **270,000+ total views.** [Click here for a reel of some featured stock footage](https://www.youtube.com/embed/29Kw6ZxRRug?list=PL5ko6Bid5lNdqgwUmU0dyznUyxXmGCT6k) from FCCYSF contributors.

## Contributors

These are the people who make FCCYSF happen by contributing some of their footage to the project, for free. Please check them out.

As you can see, the project has two sides: both footage users and footage contributors can benefit. Here's how it works:

## FCCYSF for Footage Users

1. Go to <a href="http://youtube.com/fccysf">the FCCSYF channel</a>, and look through the footage through the search bar, the playlists of similar videos, and/ or the videos tab.
1. Use a YouTube downloader (either installed or online) to download the footage.
1. Use the footage for your video project, and give the original creator a shoutout or credit (and link to the FCCYSF channel if you're in a really good mood).
1. We love hearing about what you do with our footage! You can email videos you've made using FCCYSF footage to [fccysf@gmail.com](mailto:fccysf@gmail.com), and they might be featured on the [twitter account](https://twitter.com/fccysf).

## FCCYSF for Footage Contributors<
