description: "A 2013 Rye Arts Center event for which I made a promo video."

"Painters on Location" is an annual Rye Arts Center event. During the day, Rye artists find a place in or around town and make a painting of it; then, at night, there's a live auction for the art made that day.

This is the promo video I made for the 2013 event:

The music is "On Top of the World" by Imagine Dragons.
