description: "Stop Freebooting Now was a tool to help freebooting victims retaliate by documenting and calling out websites and social media pages that steal online creators' original content."
---

Freebooting is taking a creator's original online media — videos, music, art, web comics, etc. — and rehosting it on your own website or social media account. [Stop Freebooting Now](http://web.archive.org/web/20150714214056/http://stopfreebootingnow.com:80/) was a project to educate consumers about freebooting and to document and publicize cases thereof.

The website covers what freebooting is, and what you can do about it: when you spot a case of freebooting, you can [file a report](http://web.archive.org/web/20150714214056/http://stopfreebootingnow.com:80/m/#report), which Stop Freebooting Now then verifies and posts on the "Wall of Shame."

Additionally, the reported case is tweeted out on [@stopfreebooting](http://twitter.com/stopfreebooting), where followers' retweets call attention to the case and the person caught freebooting, hopefully to the point that the content is taken down and/ or the original creator is compensated.

The project is written in Python and runs on [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs), and was inspired by [Brady Haran](http://twitter.com/bradyharan) and [CGP Grey](http://twitter.com/cgpgrey)'s [Hello Internet](http://hellointernet.fm) podcast, where the former coined the term "freebooting."
