description: "Inspired by Twitch Plays Pokemon, my team and I created a little robot car that multiple people could drive around the room with their phones."

Inspired by the online sensation [Twitch Plays Pokémon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_Plays_Pok%C3%A9mon) — in which thousands of players try to control the game at the same time — my team and I thought it'd be fun to build something similar at [Hack the North](http://hackthenorth.com/).

From 3D printing and an Arduino, to Firebase and Google App Engine, we used a ton of different technologies to get it off the floor. And in the end, it worked pretty well! See the video below:

Personally, I was responsible for the App Engine + Firebase backend, and I did some work on the website to control the robot as well.

Hack the North was a ton of fun, and it was amazing to meet so many other hackers — especially my teammates: Victoria Henri, Alicia Yu and Shashank Sabhlok!
