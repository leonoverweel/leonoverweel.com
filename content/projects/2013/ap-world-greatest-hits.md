"AP World Greatest Hits: An Epic Poem of the Farces and Tragedies of History" is the video my friends and I made for our final AP World project. Clocking in at over eleven minutes long, it covers five periods of world history, and features no less than six different songs. Here it is:

These are the songs:

- 0:00 - Bohemian Rhapsody (Queen)
- 1:00 - We Didn't Start the Fire (Billy Joel)
- 2:09 - Wonderful World (Sam Cooke)
- 3:40 - Under Pressure (Queen)
- 5:33 - In The Jungle (The Tokens)
- 7:06 - Johnny B. Goode (Chuck Berry)

The video took us a couple of days to make, and was an instant hit around school: we got a few hundred views right after we put it up. What's really cool, though, is that every year we've seen huge peaks in views the week before the AP World exam (thousands of views a day). The video now has **over 43,000 views** overall.
