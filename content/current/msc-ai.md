I just finished my [MSc in Artificial Intelligence](https://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/degrees?id=107&r=site/view) at the University of Edinburgh, where I rowed in the [EUBC Rec crew](http://www.edinburghrowing.co.uk/).
The MSc consisted of two semesters of coursework, followed by a thesis project during the summer.
For my thesis, I was at [Adyen](https://adyen.com) in Amsterdam, working on transfer learning for credit card fraud prediction models.
