I'm a student at the University of Edinburgh, doing an [MSc in Artificial Intelligence](https://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/degrees?id=107&r=site/view) and rowing in the [EUBC Rec crew](http://www.edinburghrowing.co.uk/). The MSc consists of two semesters of machine learning coursework, followed by a thesis project during the summer. For my thesis, I'll be at [Adyen](https://adyen.com) in Amsterdam, working on transfer learning for credit card fraud prediciton models.
